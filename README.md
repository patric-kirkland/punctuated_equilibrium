# Punctuated Equilibrium

The goals of the Punctuated Equilibrium project are lofty, probably not even achievable, but I feel the need to try it out anyway.

"Punctuated equilibrium" is an evolution concept that is counter to the evolutionary concept of "gradualism." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuated_equilibrium) When we look at fossil records, we see that speciation remains relatively stable for long periods of time only to be disrupted by short periods of massive speciation change until a balance of sorts is achieved. It's almost as if the small changes that are a part of everyday species adaptation build to a breaking point and something needs to happen to rebalance the system.

This software project is going to explore the same "punctuated equilibrium" phenomena applied to artificial intelligence. 

Thus *punctuated_equilibrium.*

The project starts with the following caveats:

* A perfect AI (p-AI) exists as a finite string of bytes representing op codes to run on a processor.
* With enough time and computing power, we can use random (or, perhaps, genetic) algorithms to create said p-AI.

For anyone familiar with the SETI@home project (http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/), you can see parallels for what we are hoping to achieve. Instead of looking for intelligence outside of our world, we will be looking to create intelligence in our computers.

In order to discover the p-AI, we need lots of computing time, so we are planning on writing software that will use either random or genetic algorithms to discover the p-AI. In order to get the amount of computing power we need, we will provide software and incentives for individuals to run this software on their machines.

The amount of computing power in the world is increasing at an even faster exponetial rate than in the past (largely due to the proliferation of multiple mobile devices), so we think the goals are indeed possible, if not entirely obvious.

Here is a short (and incomplete) list of modules/stages that need to be written:

* Need to find out a random or genetic algorithm and test bed for discovering the p-AI
* Need to write software for all platforms of computing
** Linux
** Windows
** Macos
** iOS
** Android
** Arduino

while the goals of punctuated_equilibrium may seem lofty and unlikely, the question remains "what if is *can* be done?" Shouldn't we at least try?
